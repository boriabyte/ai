Repository for all my AI-oriented exercises and programs


This repository is a place where I can store all my exercises while learning machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, image processing and everything that is AI related. It can also act as a documentation of my way of learning and as a repository for my portolio and projects.

I will try to not only store small exercises and problems, but also bigger applications as my knowledge broadens.
